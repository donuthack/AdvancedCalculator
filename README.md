# AdvancedCalculator
My tasks were to write bash script based on the following requirements:


Bash script requirements (* - additional requirement, more additional requirements === more experience and a chance to receive higher score)

Please create bash script with the following capabilities:

Implement a simple calculator using bash. It should receive two numbers and a desired operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as an input. Users should be able to enter the aforementioned data one by one during the program execution. Results of calculation should be printed back to the user.

* Make the process from the previous step repeatable. It means that a user needs to launch the program only once and then perform any number of calculations before he/she decides to exit the program. Please implement a mechanism that would allow a user to stop the program by sending the appropriate input (not by pressing Ctrl+C :)) )

** Add a new functions to the program that allow to read files (by specifying their path), query websites and display received responses 





And also almost same task to write Python script based on the following requirements:


Python script requirements (* - additional requirement, more additional requirements === more experience and a chance to receive higher score)

Please create python script with the following capabilities:

Implement a simple calculator using Python. It should receive two numbers and a desired operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as an input. Users should be able to enter the aforementioned data one by one during the program execution. Results of calculation should be printed back to the user.

** Add new functions to the program that allow users to read files (by specifying their path), query websites and display received responses, and execute OS commands.
